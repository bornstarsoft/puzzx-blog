The recent launch of MindsEye has left IO Interactive's future in game publishing hanging in the balance. Following a disastrous reception marked by technical issues and a dismal Metacritic score, the company's CEO, Hakan Abrak, expressed uncertainty about continuing to publish games from other studios. This situation serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in game publishing, especially for a company that has just begun to explore this avenue.

IO Interactive, known for its successful Hitman franchise, had high hopes for its publishing venture, IOI Partners. However, the backlash from MindsEye has prompted a reevaluation of their strategy moving forward. While Abrak remains optimistic about the potential of Build a Rocket Boy, the question remains: will IOI continue to support other studios, or will it focus solely on its internal projects?

As the gaming community watches closely, the future of IOI Partners will be determined by how well Build a Rocket Boy can recover from this setback. Will they regain the trust of gamers and pave the way for future collaborations, or will this be a cautionary tale for other developers looking to partner with established studios? Only time will tell.
