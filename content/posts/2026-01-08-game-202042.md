The recently launched visual puzzle game AiliA invites players into a captivating world where reality and reflection intertwine. Developed by IceToad Studio LLC and published by Gamirror Games, this 3D puzzle adventure features innovative mirror-based gameplay mechanics that challenge players to think creatively and strategically. With over 100 puzzles to solve across seven visually distinct areas, AiliA promises an engaging experience for puzzle enthusiasts.

In AiliA, players assume the role of Aria, a young girl navigating through stages that blur the lines between the real world and a mirrored dimension. The mirrors in the game are not just passive reflections; they are interactive elements that players can manipulate to uncover new paths and solutions. This unique mechanic adds depth to the gameplay, making each puzzle a rewarding challenge.

For those eager to dive into this reflective journey, a free demo is available on Steam, allowing players to experience the enchanting world of AiliA before committing to the full game. With a launch price of $11.99 and a special collaboration bundle featuring Moncage, now is the perfect time to explore the mysteries hidden within the memories of sisters Aria and Lia. Will you be able to solve the puzzles that lie ahead?
