Japan's National Diet Library (NDL) has made a significant decision regarding the preservation of video game media, stating that it will not include Nintendo's Switch 2 Game-Key Cards in its collection. This choice highlights the evolving nature of digital content and the challenges libraries face in preserving modern media formats. The NDL, established in 1948, is responsible for archiving all new publications in Japan, including physical video games since 2000. However, the Game-Key Cards, which serve merely as keys for downloading games rather than containing the actual game data, do not meet the library's criteria for preservation.

This decision raises important questions about the future of video game preservation. As digital distribution becomes more prevalent, how will institutions adapt to ensure that all forms of media, especially those reliant on online platforms, are preserved for future generations? The exclusion of Game-Key Cards from the NDL's collection may set a precedent for other libraries worldwide, prompting a reevaluation of what constitutes 'physical media' in the digital age.

As we move forward, it will be interesting to see how this impacts both the gaming industry and the preservation efforts of libraries globally. Will we find a way to preserve digital content effectively, or will we lose significant parts of our cultural heritage?
