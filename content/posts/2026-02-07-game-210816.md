In a significant move to bolster its global gaming presence, JetSynthesys has acquired the popular merge puzzle game EverMerge, which has generated over $350 million in revenue since its launch. This acquisition not only highlights JetSynthesys' ambition to expand its gaming ecosystem but also underscores the game's strong performance in key markets like the US and Western Europe. With EverMerge ranked among the top 100 highest-grossing mobile games of all time, this strategic acquisition positions JetSynthesys to tap into new growth opportunities, particularly in emerging markets such as India.

Rajan Navani, Chairman & MD of JetSynthesys, emphasized the importance of this acquisition in bridging global intellectual properties with local insights. The company aims to enhance EverMerge's appeal through culturally resonant storytelling and innovative engagement strategies. As JetSynthesys continues to invest in the game's content and community, the future looks promising for both the company and its expanding player base. Will this acquisition set a new standard for mobile gaming in emerging markets?
