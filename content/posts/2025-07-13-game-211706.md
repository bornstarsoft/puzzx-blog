If you're a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to grab a copy of Haus Of Irndrous for free on Steam! Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror puzzle game is currently available at no cost until July 19, 2025. After this date, the game will transition to a paid model, costing $1.99. This unique opportunity allows players to experience the first chapter of the game without any financial commitment, making it an enticing offer for horror enthusiasts.

Haus Of Irndrous, which launched in early access in August 2024, was designed as an episodic experience. The developers have indicated that while the first chapter will remain free, subsequent episodes will be sold separately. The decision to monetize the game stems from the need to fund future development and support auxiliary servers, a move that reflects a growing trend in the gaming industry where early access titles shift to paid models.

As the game evolves, Yxtopia Studios is keen on gathering player feedback to shape future updates and expansions. With recent updates enhancing enemy AI and overall performance, players can expect a more refined experience as they delve into the eerie world of Haus Of Irndrous. Will you take advantage of this limited-time offer and dive into the chilling puzzles and narratives that await?
