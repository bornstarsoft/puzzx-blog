The director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, Naoki Hamaguchi, has reassured fans that the upcoming third installment will maintain high quality despite its multiplatform release. In a recent interview, he emphasized that the development structure is designed to ensure that quality is not compromised, regardless of the platform. This is a significant insight for gamers concerned about performance on lower-spec systems like the Xbox Series S and the upcoming Switch 2.

Hamaguchi elaborated on the technical aspects of the games development, explaining that the team prioritizes high-end specifications while scaling down for lower-end platforms. This means that while the game will run smoothly on systems with less power, it will still take full advantage of the capabilities of high-end PCs and consoles. The philosophy of developing with a high-spec PC as the lead platform allows for richer environments and more dynamic gameplay.

As we look forward to the release of Part 3, its exciting to see how these technical decisions will enhance the gaming experience across multiple platforms. Will this approach set a new standard for future multiplatform titles? Let's keep an eye on the developments as they unfold.
