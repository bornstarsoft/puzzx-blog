Exciting news for gamers! The beloved Far Cry 3 Classic Edition is set to receive a significant update that will enhance the gameplay experience on PS5 and PS5 Pro by introducing 60 FPS support. This update, confirmed by Ubisoft and shared via the official PlayStation YouTube account, promises to bring a smoother and more fluid experience to this classic title originally released in 2012.

The update is scheduled for release on January 21, and while Xbox Series X and S players have already enjoyed 60 FPS gameplay, many PS4 owners are left disappointed without a similar upgrade. For those looking to dive back into the action, Far Cry 3 Classic Edition is available as part of the Far Cry Anthology Bundle, currently on sale for $37.49 until January 22.

As we anticipate this update, it raises questions about how classic games can continue to evolve on modern consoles. Will this trend lead to more updates for other beloved titles? Only time will tell!
