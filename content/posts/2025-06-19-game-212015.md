In a world where creativity meets adversity, the story of **Ministry of Order** stands out. Developed by the husband-and-wife team VoltekPlay, this narrative puzzle game not only offers engaging gameplay but also serves as a testament to resilience in the face of challenges. Originally conceived during Brackey’s Game Jam 2025.1, the game faced a tumultuous journey, including being stolen and misrepresented. However, the developers have reclaimed their creation, and it’s poised to make waves in the gaming community.

Set against a backdrop reminiscent of a totalitarian 1920s, players assume the role of the Custodian of Bloodlines, tasked with matching babies to their rightful parents amidst a society where birth records have been obliterated. This unique premise, combined with charming hand-drawn visuals and gameplay mechanics akin to *Papers, Please*, promises a rich experience for puzzle enthusiasts. As players navigate through moral dilemmas and dialogue choices, they can influence the narrative, potentially igniting a revolution or simply striving for survival.

While there’s no official release date yet, fans can already wishlist the game on Steam and explore its prologue available on both Google Play and the App Store. As we await the full launch, one can't help but wonder: how will the intertwining of personal stories and political themes resonate with players in today's world?
