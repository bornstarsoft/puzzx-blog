In a recent interview, Kosuke Yabuki, the producer of Mario Kart World, revealed a fascinating insight into the game's character selection process: the decision to exclude crossover characters from other Nintendo franchises was intentional. Yabuki explained that the development team felt that introducing characters from other games would disrupt the cohesive Mario-themed universe they aimed to create. This focus on the core Mario experience allows players to immerse themselves fully in the vibrant world of familiar characters and settings.

While previous entries in the series, such as Mario Kart 8, featured iconic characters like Link and Isabelle, Mario Kart World opts for a more streamlined approach. By concentrating solely on the Super Mario universe, the game introduces new racers that are primarily enemies and NPCs from past Mario titles, ensuring that fans have plenty of beloved characters to choose from. Yabuki emphasized that the team believed players would find satisfaction in the diverse roster of characters and costumes available.

Interestingly, Yabuki's favorite new racer, the Cow, has garnered significant popularity online, showcasing the community's enthusiasm for fresh additions to the game. The positive reception of these new characters exceeded the team's expectations, proving that even within a familiar framework, there's room for innovation and surprise. As we look ahead, it will be intriguing to see how this commitment to the Mario legacy shapes future titles in the franchise.
