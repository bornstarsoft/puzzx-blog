In a significant move for the gaming community, HoYoverse has announced that support for Genshin Impact on the PS4 will officially end in April 2026. This decision stems from the limitations of hardware performance and platform application size, marking a pivotal shift for players still using last-gen consoles. The phased discontinuation will begin with the removal of the game from the PlayStation Store on September 10, 2025, followed by the delisting of in-game purchases on February 25, 2026, and ultimately ceasing all update support by April 8, 2026.

For players who have enjoyed Genshin Impact on PS4, this news may come as a disappointment, especially with the game's growing popularity and continuous updates. However, HoYoverse assures that the PS5 version will continue to operate normally, allowing players to transition smoothly while retaining their progress across platforms. As the gaming landscape evolves, this decision highlights the importance of upgrading to newer hardware to keep pace with advancements in game design and performance.

As we look ahead, how will this change affect the Genshin Impact community? Will players make the leap to PS5, or will they seek alternatives on other platforms? The future of gaming is undoubtedly exciting, and it will be interesting to see how players adapt to these changes.
