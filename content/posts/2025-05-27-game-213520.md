Nacon has officially regained the rights to the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC), marking a significant shift in the landscape of rally gaming. After Electronic Artsâ€™ Codemasters announced the end of its development on rally games, Nacon has signed a new agreement that grants it exclusive rights for PC and consoles for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032. This move signals a fresh start for the franchise, with Nacon promising a complete reboot aimed at delivering an immersive experience that resonates with both rally enthusiasts and newcomers alike.

Under the leadership of CEO Alain Falc, Nacon is poised to leverage its past experience with the WRC series, having developed games from 2015 to 2022. Falc emphasized the company's commitment to creating a highly refined driving experience that meets the expectations of rally fans. The new vision for the franchise aims to elevate rally games to new heights, showcasing Nacon's dedication to innovation and quality in game development.

As we look ahead, the collaboration between Nacon and WRC Promoter promises to break new ground in the gaming world. With a passionate and specialized team at the helm, fans can expect a reimagined project that not only honors the rich history of rally racing but also pushes the boundaries of what rally games can offer. Will this new direction redefine the genre and attract a broader audience? Only time will tell.
