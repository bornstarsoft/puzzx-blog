In a significant turn of events for the gaming industry, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, has announced its impending closure after failing to secure a new partner for its ambitious project, Midnight Riders. The studio, which was established in 2023 and comprised former Ubisoft Toronto staff, will cease operations on November 17th, 2025. This closure not only highlights the challenges faced by game developers in securing partnerships but also raises questions about the sustainability of studios in an increasingly competitive market.

Studio head Sean Cooks expressed gratitude towards NetEase for their support during this journey, emphasizing the team's dedication and creativity in pushing boundaries. However, despite their efforts, the search for a partner did not yield results, leading to this unfortunate conclusion. The game and its underlying intellectual property remain available for acquisition, suggesting that there may still be hope for the project under new stewardship.

As we reflect on this closure, it serves as a reminder of the volatile nature of the gaming industry. With the recent trend of NetEase scaling back its overseas studios, one must wonder what the future holds for smaller developers. Will we see a resurgence of indie studios, or will larger corporations continue to dominate the landscape?
