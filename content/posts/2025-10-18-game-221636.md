In an unexpected twist that has gaming enthusiasts buzzing, Atari is set to re-release the iconic Intellivision console, marking a significant moment in gaming history. The Intellivision Sprint, which will be available starting December 5, 2025, in the USA and Australia, and December 23 in Europe, is priced at $149.99 and comes packed with 45 classic games, making it a must-have for both nostalgic gamers and newcomers alike.

Originally launched in 1979, the Intellivision console was a pioneer in the gaming industry, famously competing against Atari during the first-ever console war. Atari's acquisition of the Intellivision brand in 2024 has paved the way for this revival, allowing fans to relive the glory days of gaming with modern enhancements such as HDMI output and wireless controllers. The inclusion of card overlays for each game is a thoughtful nod to the original experience, ensuring that players can immerse themselves fully in the gameplay.

As we celebrate the 45th anniversary of Intellivision, it's exciting to see how Atari is bridging the past with the present. Will the Intellivision Sprint reignite the passion for retro gaming, or will it simply be a nostalgic trip down memory lane? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the gaming community is ready for this revival.
