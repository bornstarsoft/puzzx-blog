Indie game development team Team Afternoon is set to release their innovative game, "Don't You Trust Me?" on February 6, 2026, and it promises to be a refreshing take on the puzzle genre. This game invites players to step into the shoes of a video editor tasked with creating a flawless "fake clear video" of a failed dungeon raid, all wrapped in a nostalgic Windows 98 aesthetic. The unique concept not only challenges players' creativity but also their strategic thinking as they manipulate clips to craft a narrative that is both satirical and engaging.

At the heart of the game lies an 8-tick timeline editing system, where players must analyze enemy attack patterns and arrange various action clips to create the illusion of a perfect victory. The developers emphasize that precision is key, stating, "Not a single frame of compromise is acceptable when it comes to creating miracles." This focus on meticulous editing, combined with post-processing VFX features, allows players to transform mundane gameplay into dramatic sequences, enhancing the overall experience.

As players navigate the ironic contrast between the hero's bold requests and the chaotic reality of their gameplay, they are drawn into a narrative that critiques the nature of heroism in gaming. With its blend of turn-based strategy, puzzle-solving, and simulation, "Don't You Trust Me?" is poised to captivate a diverse audience. Will you be ready to create your own miracles when it launches for free on Steam?
