Netflix is stepping into the daily puzzle game arena with its new app, Netflix Puzzled, which promises to engage fans of its most popular franchises. This innovative move will allow subscribers to enjoy themed puzzles based on beloved series like Stranger Things, Bridgerton, and Squid Game, among others. With a variety of classic and fresh puzzle formats, including sudoku and crosswords, Netflix is set to enhance the interactive experience for its audience.

The app will be available soon on both iOS and Android, and intriguingly, it will also be the first Netflix game accessible through the Tudum website. Best of all, it comes at no extra cost for Netflix subscribers, making it an attractive addition to the platform's growing gaming portfolio. As Netflix continues to diversify its offerings, one can't help but wonder how this new venture will reshape the landscape of streaming and gaming integration. Will daily puzzle games become the next big trend for entertainment platforms?
