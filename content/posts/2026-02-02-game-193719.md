In a significant shift for players, Respawn has announced that the Nintendo Switch version of Apex Legends will be shutting down this summer, with the final update arriving in Season 29. This change means that players will need to transition to the upcoming Switch 2 version to continue enjoying the game and retain their in-game currency. As of August 4, 2026, the current version will no longer be playable, marking a pivotal moment for the game's community on the platform.

For those who have invested in Apex Coins on the Switch, it's crucial to act before the shutdown. Players can either spend their currency before the deadline or upgrade to the Switch 2 version to keep their balance intact. While cross-progression exists for other platforms, Switch players will find that their currency remains exclusive to Nintendo, adding a layer of urgency to the transition.

As we look ahead, the investment in the Nintendo Switch 2 promises a more robust gaming experience, and Respawn's commitment to evolving Apex Legends suggests exciting developments on the horizon. Will you be making the switch to the new platform, or will you explore other gaming options? Let's discuss!
