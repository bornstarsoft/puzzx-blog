According to the latest State of the Game Industry survey by the Game Developers Conference (GDC), developers are showing a clear preference for creating games on the PS5 and Switch 2, with interest in Xbox games lagging significantly. The survey, which gathered insights from over 2,300 industry professionals, revealed that only 20% of respondents expressed interest in developing for Xbox Series X/S, compared to 40% for PS5 and 39% for Switch 2.

This shift in developer sentiment is noteworthy, especially considering that 40% of respondents reported their last project was released on Xbox Series X/S, indicating a potential disconnect between past experience and future interest. Factors such as audience reach and discoverability are heavily influencing platform choices, suggesting that Xbox may need to rethink its strategy to attract developers moving forward.

As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how Microsoft adapts its approach to regain developer interest. Will they pivot their strategy to better align with the preferences of game creators?
