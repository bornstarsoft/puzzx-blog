The popularity of cosy video games, often referred to as "comfort games," is surging as players seek low-stress gameplay to unwind. While these games provide a soothing escape, experts warn that they may also encourage unhealthy escapism, leading players to avoid confronting real-life challenges and emotions.

As more individuals turn to these games for relaxation, concerns about their impact on mental health are growing. While they can offer temporary relief from daily stresses, excessive gaming may foster feelings of isolation and disconnection. It's crucial for players to maintain a balanced approach to gaming, ensuring that their love for cosy games does not morph into a dependency.

As the trend continues to evolve, how can players enjoy the comfort of these games while remaining mindful of their mental well-being?
