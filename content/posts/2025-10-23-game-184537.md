The recent appearance of an HD remaster of "Scarface: The World is Yours" has sparked significant controversy, particularly among the gaming community and modders. A modder has raised concerns that this release may not be legitimate, claiming that the film's IP owner, NBCUniversal, was unaware of the remaster's launch. This revelation invites gamers to question the authenticity of the product before making a purchase.

Initially listed on the Epic Games Store and later on Steam, the game was priced at $29.99 and purported to include an "optional HD graphics upgrade" utilizing AI-assisted techniques. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the game is merely the existing PC version bundled with fan-made patches, raising further doubts about its legitimacy. The publisher has since stated they are in urgent discussions regarding the projects status, indicating that the situation is still fluid.

As the gaming community awaits clarity on this issue, it serves as a reminder of the complexities surrounding game licensing and remasters. Will players heed the warnings and hold off on purchasing until the dust settles, or will the allure of nostalgia prove too tempting? Only time will tell.
