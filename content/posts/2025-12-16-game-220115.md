Bungie has officially announced the release date and pricing for its highly anticipated extraction shooter, Marathon. Set to launch in March 2026, the game will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC for a price of $39.99. This announcement comes after a delay that allowed the developers to refine the game based on community feedback, ensuring a polished experience for players.

One of the standout features of Marathon is its commitment to a fair gaming environment, with no pay-to-win mechanics. Players will have access to all gameplay updates, including maps and events, through a reward pass that wont expire. This approach reflects Bungie's dedication to building a game that prioritizes player experience and community engagement.

As we look forward to the release, its exciting to see how Bungie integrates player feedback into the final product. Will Marathon live up to the expectations set by its predecessors? Only time will tell as we gear up for its launch in early 2026.
