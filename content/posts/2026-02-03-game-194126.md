In a groundbreaking shift for sports gaming, Netflix is set to release a new FIFA game, spearheaded by Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer of Konamis Fox Engine. This innovative approach aims to reimagine the FIFA series from the ground up, especially now that the brand is no longer tied to EA Sports. With Merceron's extensive background in developing football games, including the acclaimed Metal Gear Solid 5, expectations are high for this fresh take on the beloved franchise.

Delphi Interactive, the studio behind this ambitious project, is collaborating with Refactor Games to create a unique gaming experience that will stream directly to televisions, utilizing mobile phones as controllers. This model not only reflects the evolving landscape of gaming but also aligns with Netflix's strategy of integrating interactive content into its platform. As Merceron stated, the focus is on delivering a game that is both accessible and rich in depth, appealing to a broader audience while honoring the essence of football gaming.

As we look forward to the summer release coinciding with the World Cup, the question remains: will this new direction redefine how we experience sports games in the streaming era? Only time will tell, but one thing is certainNetflix is making waves in the gaming industry.
