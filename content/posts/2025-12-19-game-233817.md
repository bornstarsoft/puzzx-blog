Gamirror Games is set to launch AiliA, a groundbreaking visual mirror-based puzzle game, on January 9, 2026. This unique title, developed by IceToad Studio LLC, invites players into a captivating 3D adventure where they manipulate mirrors to navigate between reality and its mirrored counterpart. The game's protagonist, Aria, embarks on a quest to rescue her twin sister trapped behind the glass, making for a compelling narrative that intertwines exploration and puzzle-solving.

What sets AiliA apart is its innovative gameplay mechanics that allow players to reshape their environment by moving and rotating mirrors. Unlike traditional puzzle games, the mirrored world is fully interactive, enabling players to walk on reflected pathways and activate mechanisms. With over 100 meticulously crafted puzzles across seven visually distinct stages inspired by Eastern aesthetics, AiliA promises to challenge players' spatial awareness and creative thinking.

As the release date approaches, a playable demo is already available on Steam, allowing eager gamers to get a taste of this enchanting experience. Will AiliA redefine the puzzle genre and captivate a global audience? Only time will tell, but it certainly has the potential to be a standout title in 2026.
