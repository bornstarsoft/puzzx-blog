When we think of competitive esports, titles like fast-paced shooters and intricate MOBAs typically come to mind. However, the recent showcase of Blue Prince at the Summer Games Done Quick event has proven that even a single-player puzzle game can captivate audiences in a thrilling competitive format. Speedrunners Randringtail and BobbyBurm took the stage for a unique B Quest Bingo race, transforming the game into a nail-biting spectacle.

The competition involved a bingo board filled with objectives based on Blue Princes complex floorplan, where each runner raced against the clock to complete tasks like unlocking gates and gathering upgrades. This format not only highlighted the players' deep understanding of the game but also their ability to think on their feet, adapting to the game's random elements in real-time. The excitement was palpable, with the live audience cheering for every strategic move.

As we witness the evolution of esports, its fascinating to see how games like Blue Prince can carve out their niche in the competitive landscape. Will we see more puzzle games take the spotlight in future esports events? Only time will tell.
