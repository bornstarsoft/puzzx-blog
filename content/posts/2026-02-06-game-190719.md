Konami is set to delight fans with the release of a 13-game Goemon collection this summer, bringing classic titles to the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and PC. This compilation, titled "Ganbare Goemon! Daishuugou," showcases beloved entries from the Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy eras, making it a must-have for both nostalgic gamers and newcomers alike.

The collection promises to enhance the gaming experience with new features like rewind, quick save, and turbo buttons, alongside a music player and a gallery of instruction manuals. With titles such as "The Legend of the Mystical Ninja" and "Ganbare Goemon 3," players can expect a mix of humor and engaging gameplay that has defined the series.

As the collection will initially be available only in Japan, it raises the question: will Konami expand its reach to international audiences? With the growing interest in retro gaming, it seems likely that this nostalgic journey could find a home in many more players' libraries around the world.
