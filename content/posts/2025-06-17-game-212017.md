The excitement is building as Six One Indie gears up for its September 2025 Showcase, scheduled for September 18. Following the success of their May event, which featured an impressive lineup of 48 indie games, this upcoming showcase promises to deliver even more indie game goodness with around 45 titles, including some that have yet to be released. This is a fantastic opportunity for gamers and developers alike to connect and discover new, innovative games.

In addition to the main showcase, there will be a pre-show featuring games that are set to release before the event, ensuring that attendees get a sneak peek at what's on the horizon. The event will also coincide with a Steam event showcasing around 200 games, making it a must-attend for anyone passionate about indie gaming. Developers looking to showcase their games can submit their titles from June 20 to July 8 at sixoneindie.com/showcase.

As the indie gaming scene continues to thrive, events like the Six One Indie Showcase play a crucial role in highlighting the creativity and diversity within the industry. Are you excited to see what new games will be unveiled this September?
