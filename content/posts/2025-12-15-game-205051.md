Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, not only revives a piece of gaming history but also includes a detailed manual that chronicles the game's troubled past and Oberth's career. The project highlights the importance of preserving 8-bit gaming history, with profits supporting the VGHF's archival efforts.

As gaming enthusiasts, we often overlook the stories behind the games we love. The resurrection of Xcavator serves as a reminder of the challenges developers face and the significance of preserving our digital heritage. Will this trend of reviving lost games inspire more developers to share their untold stories? Let's hope so!
